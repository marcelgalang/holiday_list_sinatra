# holiday_list_sinatra
A simple Sinatra app to help you keep track of your holiday shopping. The app lets you make a list of recipients and thier gifts. You may only see the gifts you are giving on your list but may see how many other gifts are being given. Like seeing a christmas tree filled underneath.  Enjoy.
